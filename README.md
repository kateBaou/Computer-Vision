## Object recognition/ Computer Vision ##

The folders contain the .cpp code for 2 object recognition challenges. 

- The first one implements the hough space and the sobel operaton on an image of 
coins and it aims to detect their shapes.
- The second one contains the implementation of the Viola-Jones and Hough transform
object detection algorithm. It focuses on detecting dartboards in well and poorly 
light images.
